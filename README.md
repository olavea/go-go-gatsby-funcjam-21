# Ruby's TimeShip

Ruby Reckless built a TimeShip fueled by gold. To save her sister Princess Lizabeth from prison in the Tower of London. You can build your own serverless Gatsby Function TimeShip.

1.  **Start developing.**

    To get started clone this repo locally and run `npm install` to add all necessary packages.

    ```shell
    cd go-go-gatsby-funcjam-21
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start practicing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! You can test the function at http://localhost:8000/api/time-ship?city=oslo&year=2026&price=333

    Edit the serverless Gatsby Function TimeShip in `src/api/time-ship.js` and put your own name into the `src/pages/index.js`

3.  **Deploy**

You can deploy this example on Gatsby Cloud by copying the example into a new repo and [connecting that to Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-gatsby-cloud/#set-up-an-existing-gatsby-site).
